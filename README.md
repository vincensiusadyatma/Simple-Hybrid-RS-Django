# Hybrid Recommendation System Schemes

This project implements **three recommendation system schemes** tailored to the **user status** within the application. Each recommendation type adapts to the availability of user data, ensuring relevant and personalized suggestions.

## Recommendation System Schemes Based on User Status

| User Status                          | Recommendation Method                    | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ðŸ”¹ 1. First-Time Visitor (No Login, No Data)   | Rating-Based Filtering (Popularity-Based)    | Recommends items with high average ratings or popularity across all users. Ideal for first-time visitors without any personal or interaction data. |
| ðŸ”¹ 2. Logged In (Only Personal Data) | Content-Based Filtering                  | Uses user's personal preferences such as budget range, preferred hotel types, and desired facilities. |
| ðŸ”¹ 3. Logged In (With History)       | Collaborative Filtering / Hybrid Filtering | Suggests options based on users with similar behaviors, ratings, or booking histories. Combines content and collaborative methods for improved accuracy. |

##  Key Concepts

- **Demographic Filtering**: Simulates group-level preferences when individual data is not available.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Analyzes userâ€™s profile and preferred attributes to recommend similar items.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Leverages community data â€” users with similar tastes â€” for generating suggestions.
- **Hybrid Filtering**: Combines multiple filtering methods for optimal recommendations.
